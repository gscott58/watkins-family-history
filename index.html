        <p>
          I put together the “<strong>Watkins Family History</strong>” web page as a tribute to your mother.&nbsp; My intent was to tell how she met your father and how they journeyed with <u>four</u> children from the Carolinas to Chicago, Illinois.
        </p>

        <p>
          And to tell how upon arriving in Chicago, you' all family grew.&nbsp;  I also wanted to provide an opportunity for each of your sisters and brothers to write their own "<strong>life story</strong>".
        </p>

        <p>
          Like my mother, your mother has passed away, leaving her life and times story for your family to reminisce.  <strong>No</strong> darkness can be spoken of the <strong>tribute</strong> I put together for your mother.
        </p>

        <p>It is the life and times of your mother that lives on in you. Like how you always speak of your mother sitting at the head of her table with a dish rag in hand, ready to feed her family and wipe up any spills.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's sad your sisters and brothers will be deprived of your mother's life and times story because you put a shroud of darkness over the tribute I put together for her.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite how you feel, your mother's spirit lives on in each of you anyway. . .
